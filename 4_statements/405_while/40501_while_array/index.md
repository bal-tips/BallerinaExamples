In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to use a while loop to iterate through arrays in Ballerina. We'll use an integer array and a JSON array for this example and explain each line of code to ensure you understand how the while loop works.

## Running the Example

To run this example on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Ballerina is installed on your machine. If not, download it from the [official Ballerina website](https://ballerina.io).
2. Clone [this repository]({{< data "repo" >}}) to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory `{{< pwd >}}`.
4. Run the command `bal run`. 

The output will sequentially display the elements of an integer array and a JSON array, demonstrating the correct execution of the while loops in the program.
